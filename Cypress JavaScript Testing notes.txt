1. Advantages of Cypress: it uses real browsers, which is identical to user experience
Element visibility, taking videos and other resources if tests fail

2. Disadvantages of Cypress: test scripts can only be in JS, can NOT test multiple pages, cannot visit multiple domains in the same test

3. In terminal, write in npm init -y to initialize our directory as a npm package and create a package.json file

4. To install cypress, write in npm install --save--dev cypress

5. After the installation is done, write in npx cypress open 

6. In the e2e folder, create first_test.cy.js file (it is cy, not spec)

7. In the target app, in the terminal, write npm install. A node_modules folder (for npm dependencies) will show up

8. Write npm run start to start the app

9. it is not recommended to use HTML tags as selectors, because it is much dependent on the current status of the app. The app can change. HTML tags are not unique.

10. It is recommended to use "data-cy=" value of each element

11. To help reduce the repetitive codes, use aliasing elements. Need to use @ to use alias

12. remember to save the cy.js files, so the tests can run

13. In order for the debugger to work, open the Inspect in the browser, run the test again, and the debugger will stop where the debugger is.

14. Press the Resume script execution button or F8

15. Under Inspect, choose Console, type in 'subject', it returns the current subject Cypress is calling, so you can inspect the subject. You can try stuff like subject.text()
